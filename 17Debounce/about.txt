We want to trigger a function, but only once per use case.
Let's say that we want to show suggestions for a search query, but only after a visitor has finished typing it.
Or we want to save changes on a form, but only when the user is not actively working on those changes, as every "save" costs us a database trip.


Practical realtime example:


The term debounce comes from electronics. When you’re pressing a button, let’s say on your TV remote, the signal travels to the microchip of the remote so quickly that before you manage to release the button, 
it bounces, and the microchip registers your “click” multiple times.
To mitigate this, once a signal from the button is received, the microchip stops processing signals from the button for a few microseconds while it’s physically impossible for you to press it again.
