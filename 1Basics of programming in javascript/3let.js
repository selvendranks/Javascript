// difference between let and var is that in var you can declare 
// same variable multiple times but you can't do that with let


//another main difference between var and let is that let if 
// declared inside a block exists only inside the block but where as the 
// var exists througout the function even if it was declared inside a block


let string = "mohit"
let string = "don"
console.log(string)
