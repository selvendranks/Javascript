basic theory

Ajax : asynchronous javascript 

with AJAX , web application can send and retrieve
data from server asynchronously  (in the background)
without interfering with the display and behaviour of the 
existing page

We have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
1.) xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
2.) fetch API (new way of doing)
3.) axios (this third party library)
